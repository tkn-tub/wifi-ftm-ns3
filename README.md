# FTM-ns3
The **Fine-Time Measurement (FTM)** protocol introduced in **IEEE 802.11-2016** uses radio frequency based **time-of-flight estimation** which enables precise indoor ranging and   positioning. We present **FTM-ns3**, an extension for the widely used **ns3 network simulator** to support the 802.11 FTM protocol. Using results from experiments with real FTM  hardware we developed error models which allow to analyze the impact of channel bandwidth and multipath channel propagation on the performance of FTM-based ranging or  localization schemes. Our extension is provided to the community as open source.
